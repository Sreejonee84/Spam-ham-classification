# Spam-ham-classification
Aim of the project is to test several classifier on the given dataset so as to achieve a proper accurate result, so that finally we can distinguish spam and ham from a set of messages.

# PROBLEM
There can be different kind of spam messages we often face in our day to day lives, like we often receive message saying, “You have won Rs 1 crore in such and such tournament, provide us your details to receive your cash prize”, or messages like “lose your weight in 10 days by clicking so and so website and get the mantra to lose weight”. This kind of messages often trick and fool you, causing you to fall in their trap. Certain times these messages just take up your space in your cell phones and computers but there are cases where these messages may contain malware and viruses, which may leaks your private data content. 

# SOLUTION
This project looks at classifying spam e-mails from inboxes. Various classifiers are applied on one dataset to evaluate which classifier yields better result.  Results of the classification algorithms are compared with the spam base UCI dataset. Efficient classification of the spam messages will help us to realise about the risk factor related  from opening these messages. The project was conducted using the versatility and compatibility of Python programming language which provided the platform for the setup of the project and it was implemented and accomplished using the concepts of Machine learning.
